    "# Working with GOSIF data\n",
    "[GOSIF](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs11050517) is a science data product generated by Dr. Jingfeng Xiao's group that estimates SIF with global coverage at 0.05° (~6km/pixel) resolution on an 8-day cadence. The estimates of SIF are derived from a data-based approach that combines data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments onboard the Terra and Aqua spacecraft with OCO-2 SIF measurements and MERRA-2 meteorological model data. MODIS data from Terra and Aqua are an invaluable resource for climate analysis because they provide a 25-year record of daily global coverage imaging across 36 spectral bands. The researchers combined these data with OCO-2 SIF soundings and MERRA-2 model outputs to train a Cubist regression tree model that can predict SIF for a MODIS 0.05° grid. Importantly, GOSIF is able to provide these predictions from 2000 up to the present (although data is presently available up to 2023), meaning it includes a 14-year period before OCO-2 even launched. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will download and view SIF data, then compare its accuracy with direct SIF soundings from OCO-2 or OCO-3. Afterwards, we will see how GOSIF can be used in analysis."

    "UNH provides GOSIF in GeoTIFF format, a common file format for geospatial data. While it is possible to view colormapped GeoTIFF files in GIS software like QGIS, its default encoding is greyscale with no transparency layer for regions with no data, such as over oceans and waterways. We will therefore convert the granule you downloaded in the previous step into PNG format with a colormap \"baked in\", meaning the SIF grid points will be quantized to 8-bit. This PNG will be much easier to view in the map viewer in the next step."

    "## III. Using GOSIF data to study climate disruptions\n",
    "Now that we have walked through downloading and displaying a GOSIF product, let's discuss how this data can be used to study the impacts of climate disruptions on agriculture and ecosystems. In particular, we will look at the impact of the [2019 Midwestern Floods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Midwestern_U.S._floods) on agriculture in the Corn Belt of the United States, an event that was examined in [Yin et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019AV000140). The study used TROPOMI SIF spatially aggregated to a county level, but in this exercise we will use GOSIF data and compare the results to those found by the paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic steps we will follow are as follows:\n",
    "1. Download 8-day averaged GOSIF data from March - October of 2018 and 2019. The 2018 data will act as a control to compare against 2019, when the flooding occurred.\n",
    "2. Convert all the data to use the same color scale, from $0.0$ to $0.8$ $W/m^2/sr/μm$, so that data can be compared visually. We will also bound the data to just the US Midwest region of interest.\n",
    "3. Compile the map data into an animation to view a side-by-side comparison.\n",
    "4. Create a time series to see the year-over-year (YoY) difference in SIF within the region of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you finish running through this section, you can explore the analysis further by running these cells again with `year_a = 2012` and `year_b = 2013`. The 2012 growing season saw particularly poor corn yields in the US due to drought and extreme heat events. "
