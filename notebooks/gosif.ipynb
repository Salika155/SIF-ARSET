    "# Working with GOSIF data\n",
    "[GOSIF](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs11050517) is a science data product generated by Dr. Jingfeng Xiao's group that estimates SIF with global coverage at 0.05° (~6km/pixel) resolution on an 8-day cadence. The estimates of SIF are derived from a data-based approach that combines data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments onboard the Terra and Aqua spacecraft with OCO-2 SIF measurements and MERRA-2 meteorological model data. MODIS data from Terra and Aqua are an invaluable resource for climate analysis because they provide a 25-year record of daily global coverage imaging across 36 spectral bands. The researchers combined these data with OCO-2 SIF soundings and MERRA-2 model outputs to train a Cubist regression tree model that can predict SIF for a MODIS 0.05° grid. Importantly, GOSIF is able to provide these predictions from 2000 up to the present (although data is presently available up to 2023), meaning it includes a 14-year period before OCO-2 even launched. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will download and view SIF data, then compare its accuracy with direct SIF soundings from OCO-2 or OCO-3. Afterwards, we will see how GOSIF can be used in analysis."

If you give the function in the cell below a year value only (i.e., no month or day) it will download the annual product for that year, if available. Similarly, providing a year and a month will download the monthly product, and a year, month and day together will download the closest 8-day product. "

    "## II. Transforming a GOSIF granule into a format suitable for viewing\n",
    "UNH provides GOSIF in GeoTIFF format, a common file format for geospatial data. While it is possible to view colormapped GeoTIFF files in GIS software like QGIS, its default encoding is greyscale with no transparency layer for regions with no data, such as over oceans and waterways. We will therefore convert the granule you downloaded in the previous step into PNG format with a colormap \"baked in\", meaning the SIF grid points will be quantized to 8-bit. This PNG will be much easier to view in the map viewer in the next step."
