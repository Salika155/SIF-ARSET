    "# OCO-3 Snapshot Area Map (SAM) Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "While OCO-2 and OCO-3 use the same set of spectrometers, one development with OCO-3 has been the addition of a Pointing Mirror Assembly (PMA). The PMA allows for rapid changes in the pointing of the instrument, enabling data to be collected over contiguous 80km x 80km areas known as Snapshot Area Maps (SAMs). The science team maintains a repository of SAM acquisitions from throughout the mission on this webpage: [https://ocov3.jpl.nasa.gov/sams/](https://ocov3.jpl.nasa.gov/sams/)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will look at SAMs acquired at one site in the Cascade Mountains region of the state of Oregon, United States. This region is composed predominantly of ponderosa pine trees and cedars with a sparse understory; vegetation cover is about 60%. By comparing SAM acquisitions over time, we can observe the seasonal changes in SIF for this ecoregion, as well as the changes due to disruption. As we will see later in the exercise, a major fire burned through this region in August 2020. Additionally, there is a [FLUXNET eddy covariance tower](https://ameriflux.lbl.gov/sites/siteinfo/US-Me2) located within the boundaries of this site that can be used as a \"ground truth\" comparison to the values we observe with OCO-3."

    "In this section, we will compare daily averaged SIF from OCO-3 against tower GPP data from the US-Me-2 site. Ultimately, we will create a daily time-scale plot comparing available data from the two datasets over the period from August 2019 (the beginning of the OCO-3 mission) through the end of 2022 (the end of the Ameriflux data for this tower as of the writing of this training). This plot will look similar to figure 3b from [Pierrat et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1029/2021JG006588).\n",

    "\n",
    "Several pre-processing steps have already been taken for you. First, you will notice there is an ancillary file called \"us_me2_oco3_dates.json\" in the same directory as this notebook. This JSON file was created by studying all available data dates across the OCO-3 mission from August 2019 - December 2022 to determine when soundings within a 0.5-degree radius around the tower site were acquired, and to store the relevant locations within the granule that those soundings occurred. This search process was performed using the code sample in the Appendix notebook, so we will just discuss it conceptually here. By looping through each date in the time range of interest, we can search for (longitude, latitude) coordinate pairs that lie within the defined bounding box: in this case, $\\pm 0.25^{\\circ}$ around the tower coordinates. In the next part of the pre-processing, we extract the relevant data from each discovered granule and take the mean of all 757nm SIF data with a Quality Flag value of 0 (best) or 1 (good). The spatial means are stored in a separate JSON file that will be used as the basis for our daily SIF values in the comparison plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tower GPP data itself can be found by using the \"Download Data\" functionality on the [Ameriflux page for the tower](https://ameriflux.lbl.gov/sites/siteinfo/US-Me2), but you need your own account to do this yourself. The Ameriflux data is presented at several time scales ranging from yearly to hourly, but for this analysis we are just using the daily data. An abridged version of the daily data is included in the notebooks directory containing just the entries for August 2019 through the end of 2022."
